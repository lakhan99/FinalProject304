# starter_folder

This repository is organised as follows:

The output folder contians the RMD file where one can view the code for this paper. It also contains the pdf of this report which is a cleaned up version of the RMD with only analysis, graphs and tables being visible. Finally, the references.bib file contains the relevant Bibtex citations of the packages and sources used to construct this paper. The associated APA style citations can be found in the pdf file. 

The inputs folder creates a data folder where we uploaded the data from our desktop. This data can be downloaded from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

This also contains the datasheet pdf and rmd.

Finally, the script folder gives instructions to load in the data into R.(only after raw data has already been installed) This data also has relevant code for data cleaning, modificaiton and also creation of datasets that were used to differentiate between different weight classes. 

This repository explores the most significant factors that affect the weight levels in individuals. I was able to learn many new things such as the importance of eating between meals and also how a family history with obesity plays a significant role in how it affects individuals.
